Each market's operating days vary based on the country of the company and the market the stocks are exchanged. I need to use only 2020 data and predict 2021 Q1 data.

Predict stock price valuations on a daily, weekly and monthly basis. Recommend BUY, HOLD, SELL decisions. Maximize capital returns, minimize losses. Ideally a loss should never happen.

Success Metrics:
